# The APIs Server
The API Server is the central touch point for a Kubernetes cluster that is accessed by all users. The API server implements a RESTful API over HTTP(S), it performs all API operations and is responsible for storing API objects into a persistent storage backend, i.e. the etcd kay-value distributed database.

 * [Exploring the APIs Server](#exploring-the-apis-server)
 * [APIs Aggregation](#apis-aggregation)
 * [Custom Resources](#custom-resources)
 * [Custom Controllers](#custom-controllers)

## Accessing the APIs Server
There are many ways to access the API server through its RESTful interface. In this section, we'll see few.

### Accessing through a proxy
To make easy to explore the API server run the ``kubectl`` tool in proxy mode to expose an unauthenticated API server on ``localhost:8080`` using the following command:

    kubectl proxy --port=8080 &

Then you can explore the API with ``curl``, ``wget``, or a browser.

    curl http://localhost:8080/api/

### Accessing with a bearer token
Alternately, without the proxy, we need first to get a bearer token

    SECRET=$(kubectl get secrets | grep ^default | cut -f1 -d ' ')
    TOKEN=$(kubectl describe secret $SECRET | grep -E '^token' | cut -f2 -d':' | tr -d " ")

and then access the API Server on its listening port, i.e, ``apiserver:8443`` by default:

    curl https://apiserver:8443/api/ --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -k

### Accessing with a certificate
To access as a specific user, we can use his own key-pair certificates. For example, to access as cluster admin, we need to have access to his certificates: ``admin-key.pem`` and ``admin.pem`` as well as the certification authority ``ca.pem``

    curl --key ./admin-key.pem \
         --cert ./admin.pem \
         --cacert ./ca.pem \
         https://apiserver:8443/api/ 

To simplify the usage of the ``curl`` command with certificates, create a configuration file ``curlrc`` as following

    $ cat .curlrc
    
    --key ./admin-key.pem
    --cert ./admin.pem
    --cacert ./ca.pem 

Now we can access the API server as

    curl --config curlrc https://apiserver:8443/api/ 

### Accessing from an application
We can also access the API Server from an application running in a pod by using its service account as in the following example.

Create an ephemeral pod from a ``curl`` image and login into

    kubectl run -it --rm curl --image=kalise/curl:latest /bin/sh

Oncle logged, find the service address and port of the API Server by checking the pod env variables

    / # env | grep KUBERNETES_SERVICE

    KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443
    KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.32.0.1

To be authenticated by the API server, we need to use the service account token signed by the controller manager via the key specified ``--service-account-private-key-file`` option. This token is mounted as secret into each container and used by its service account

    / # TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)

Once we have the token, we can access the API Server from within the pod

    / # curl https://$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST:$KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT/api/ \
             --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -k

Now we can explore the API Server.

## Exploring the APIs Server
All Kubernetes requests begin with the the core APIs prefix ``/api/`` or with the grouped APIs prefix ``/apis/``. The two different sets of paths are primarily historical: API Groups did not originally exist in the Kubernetes API, so the original or core objects like Pods and Services are maintained under the core APIs without an API group. Subsequently, APIs have generally been added under API groups, so they follow the ``/apis/<api-group>/`` path.

For example, to get the list of pods

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/pods

or services

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/services

they are part of the core APIs.

The Deployment object is part of the app API group and it is found here

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/apis/apps/v1/deployments

An additional classification of resource paths is whether or not the resource is namespaced.

Here are the components of the two different paths for namespaced resource types

    http://<server>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/<resource-type>/<resource>
    http://<server>:<port>/apis/<api-group>/<api-version>/namespaces/<namespace>/<resource-type>/<resource>

Here are the components of the two different paths for no namespaced resource types

    http://<server>:<port>/api/v1/<resource-type>/<resource>
    http://<server>:<port>/apis/<api-group>/<api-version>/<resource-type>/<resource>

For example, to get all the pods running in the ``kube-system`` namespace

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/pods
    
To get a specific pod in the default namespace

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/nginx

To get all the nodes

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/nodes

because the node resource type is not namespaced.

Another grouping is based on the version of the API. For the core APIs group ``/api/`` there is only one, i.e. the ``/api/v1/`` where for the other APIs group there are many, e.g. ``/apis/<api-group>/v1``, ``/apis/<api-group>/v1beta1``, ``/apis/<api-group>/v1alpha1``, depending on the stability of the resource implementation. A particular release of Kubernetes may support multiple different versions: alpha, beta and GA for a given resource type.

To check which API-versions our cluster can handle, simply run

    $ kubectl api-versions
    
    admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
    apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
    apiregistration.k8s.io/v1
    apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1
    apps/v1
    apps/v1beta1
    apps/v1beta2
    authentication.k8s.io/v1
    authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
    authorization.k8s.io/v1
    authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    autoscaling/v1
    autoscaling/v2beta1
    batch/v1
    batch/v1beta1
    certificates.k8s.io/v1beta1
    events.k8s.io/v1beta1
    extensions/v1beta1
    metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1
    networking.k8s.io/v1
    policy/v1beta1
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
    scheduling.k8s.io/v1beta1
    storage.k8s.io/v1
    storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
    v1


There is much interesting information in the API objects that describes the API itself, the so-called meta API objects. For example, getting the core APIs 

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/

check for the pods object

```json
    {
      "name": "pods",
      "singularName": "",
      "namespaced": true,
      "kind": "Pod",
      "verbs": [
        "create",
        "delete",
        "deletecollection",
        "get",
        "list",
        "patch",
        "update",
        "watch"
      ],
      "shortNames": [
        "po"
      ],
      "categories": [
        "all"
      ]
    }
```

Looking at this object, the ``name`` field provides the name of this resource. The ``namespaced`` field in the object description indicates if the object is namespaced or not. The ``Kind`` field provides the string that is present in the API objectâ€™s JSON representation to indicate what kind of object it is. The ``verbs`` field indicates what kind of actions can be taken on that object. The pods object contains all of the possible verbs: create, delete, get, list, and so on.

The watch verb indicates that we can establish a watch for the resource. A watch is long running operation which provides notifications about changes to the object.

For example, to watch notifications from pods we can add the query parameter ``?watch=true`` to an API server request

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods?watch=true

The API server switches into watch mode, and it leaves the connection between client and server open. The data returned by the API server is no longer just the API object, it is a different object which contains both the type of the change, e.g. created, modified, deleted, as well as the API object itself. In this way a client can watch and observe all changes to that object, or set of objects instead of polling at some interval for possible updates, which introduces load and latency.

## APIs Aggregation
The aggregation layer allows Kubernetes to be extended with additional APIs, beyond what is offered by default. It enables installing additional Kubernetes-style APIs in the cluster. These can either be pre-built, existing 3rd party solutions, such as a service-catalog, or user-created APIs servers. They can either run as pods in the same kubernetes cluster or run as standalone services.

For example, the metric-server is deployed as stand-alone APIs service running as pod in kube-system namespace

    kubectl get pods -n kube-system
    NAME                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    kube-dns-598d7bf7d4-bn9pq         3/3       Running   0          17d
    metrics-server-86bd9d7667-mx9jp   1/1       Running   0          10d

## Custom Resources
Kubernetes APIs server can be extended by defining custom resources. To define a new resource type, we need to post a **Custom Resource Definition** object or **CRD** to the APIs server. The CRD object is the description of the custom resource type. Once the CRD is posted, we can then create instances of the custom resource by posting JSON or YAML manifests to the API server, the same we do with any other Kubernetes resource.

In this section, we want to allow users of kubernetes cluster to run static websites as easily as possible, without having to deal with pods, services, and other Kubernetes resources. What we want to achieve is to let users to create objects of type Website.

When a user creates an instance of the bebsite resource, we want the cluster to spin up a new deployment, a volume pointing to a Git reposistory hosting the static HTML pages, and expose the website to the external with a single action.

To make Kubernetew aware of a new custom resource type, we need to create first the related CRD as in the following ``website-crd.yaml`` definition file

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: <plural>.<group>
  name: websites.noverit.com
spec:
  # either Namespaced or Cluster
  scope: Namespaced
  # group name to use for REST API: /apis/<group>/<version>
  group: noverit.com
  # multiple versions of the same API can be served at same type
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  names:
    kind: Website
    singular: website
    plural: websites
    shortNames:
    - ws
  subresources:
    status:
    scale:
      specReplicasPath: .spec.replicas
      statusReplicasPath: .status.replicas
  validation:
    # openAPIV3Schema is the schema for validating custom objects.
    openAPIV3Schema:
      properties:
        spec:
          properties:
            gitRepo:
              type: string
            domain:
              type: string
            replicas:
              type: integer
              minimum: 0
              maximum: 9
  additionalPrinterColumns:
    - name: Desired
      type: integer
      description: The number of desired pods
      JSONPath: .spec.replicas
    - name: Ready
      type: integer
      description: The number of ready pods 
      JSONPath: .status.current
    - name: Updated
      type: integer
      description: The number of updated pods 
      JSONPath: .status.updated
    - name: Available
      type: integer
      description: The number of available pods
      JSONPath: .status.available
    - name: Generation
      type: integer
      description: The observer generation
      JSONPath: .status.generation
    - name: Age

      description: The Git repo where config files are stored
      JSONPath: .spec.gitRepo
    - name: Route
      type: string
      description: How the website is reachable from the external
      JSONPath: .status.route
```

Create the resource definition

    kubectl apply -f website-crd.yaml

Custom Resources Definitions are no namespaced objects and can be retrieved as any other kubernetes object

    kubectl get crd

    NAME                         CREATED AT
    websites.kubeo.noverit.com   2018-08-09T14:17:58Z

After we post the descriptor to Kubernetes, a new API group is available in the API server

    curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/apis/kubeo.noverit.com/v1

returning the following API object descriptor

```json
{
  "kind": "APIResourceList",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "groupVersion": "kubeo.noverit.com/v1",
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "websites",
      "singularName": "website",
      "namespaced": true,
      "kind": "Website",
      "verbs": [
        "delete",
        "deletecollection",
        "get",
        "list",
        "patch",
        "create",
        "update",
        "watch"
      ],
      "shortNames": [
        "ws"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "websites/scale",
      "singularName": "",
      "namespaced": true,
      "group": "autoscaling",
      "version": "v1",
      "kind": "Scale",
      "verbs": [
        "get",
        "patch",
        "update"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Custom resource descriptors will allow users to create any number of instances of the custom resource. For example, create a new website as in the following ``website.yaml`` descriptor file

```
apiVersion: noverit.com/v1
kind: Website
metadata:
  namespace:
  name: kubeo
  labels:
spec:
  replicas: 3
  gitRepo: https://github.com/kalise/kubeo.git
  domain: noverit.com
```

Create a new website

    kubectl apply -f website.yaml

The custom resources can be also listed, retrieved, described, updated, and deleted, as any other kubernetes object, with the ``kubectl`` command line

    kubectl get websites
    NAME    DESIRED READY UPDATED AVAILABLE GEN AGE GITREPO                               ROUTE
    kubeo   3       0     0       0         0   18s https://github.com/kalise/kubeo.git   kubeo.noverit.com

According to its semantics, a custom resource can be also scaled up and down. In our case we can scale up to 9 pod replicas since the hard limits we set in the custom resouce definition

    kubectl scale website kubia01 --replicas=9

However, creating a Custom Resource Definition, so that users can define custom objects of a new type, is unuseful if those objects donâ€™t make something tangible happening in the cluster. In our case, for example, the website we just created, only is an object stored into etcd and served by the API server but it is not running anything.

To make this an useful feature, each custom resource definition needs an associated controller, i.e. an active component doing something on the worker nodes, basing on the custom objects, the same way that all the core Kubernetes resources have an associated controller. For example, in our case, a custom website controller, will be responsible for watching the website creation events and create all the required objects, including the pods and the service, that concretely implement the website. 

## Custom Controllers
Custom Resources need associated controllers that actually implement the custom resource objects and take care of them, for example, by watching events and taking appropriate actions. These custom controllers are generically called **Operators**.

There are many operators out there but we'll define a simple operator for our website custom resource we just created in the previous section. This operator will create and control our custom websites running as a set of resources, e.g. pods, services, deployment, running on the kubernetes cluster.

To build custom controllers, at time of writing, we have three options:

   1. [Kuberbuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder)
   2. [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework)
   3. [Metacontroller](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/metacontroller)
    
**Kubebuilder** and the **Operator Framework** are quite similar: both are only intended for *GO* developers and both rely on a code generator to build custom controllers. The third option, called **Metacontroller**, takes a completely different approach: it's an actual framework, as opposed to code generator, where custom controllers are simple web hooks called by the metacontroller itself which is running as a pod in the control plane.

Once defined the custom resource in terms of the parent resource (e.g. the website), and the associated children resources (e.g. pods, services, deployments actually implementing the website), we instruct the metacontroller to map the parent with the children resources. Then the metacontroller will take care of reconciliation process between the observed and the desired state of the custom resources following the business logic defined into the web hook.

The web hooks can be written in any programming language understanding *JSON*. Please refer to this [repo](https://github.com/kalise/kube-website-controller) for an example.
